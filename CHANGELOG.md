## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-21

The distribution was renamed and the API reshaped in one release. 0.1.0 was
never published, so there are **no deprecation shims** — call sites must be
updated.

### Changed

- **Renamed the package `netutils` → `netimps`**, import name included. The old
  name is taken on PyPI and is generic.
- **`IPAddress` / `IPInterface` / `IPNetwork` are now type aliases**, not
  factory functions — the v4/v6 unions you annotate with, reading the way
  `ipaddress.IPv4Address` does. The factories took the short names `IPAddr()`,
  `IPIface()`, `IPNet()`, mirroring the stdlib's callable `ip_address()`.
- **`nslookup` was replaced by `resolve`**, which takes the record type second
  — the argument callers actually vary — instead of after the nameserver.
- **DNS lookups no longer swallow every exception into `[]`.** Genuine lookup
  failures (NXDOMAIN, no answer, all nameservers failed, timeout) still return
  `[]`; a malformed query or unknown record type now raises `ValueError`. A
  bare `except Exception` previously made a typo'd record type indistinguishable
  from "no such record".
- `timeout` bounds the **whole resolution including retries**, not a single
  query — a list of dead nameservers used to run far past any expectation.
- Renamed `is_loopback_or_link_local` → **`is_link_scoped`**, naming the shared
  property (confined to link scope or narrower) rather than listing the two
  cases. Note it is *not* "is private": RFC 1918 ranges are globally scoped and
  return `False`.

### Added

- **`get_interfaces()`** — native interface discovery with adapter names, MACs
  and *real* prefix lengths, via `ctypes` bindings to `getifaddrs(3)` (POSIX)
  and `GetAdaptersAddresses` (Windows). **No third-party dependency**; `ifaddr`
  is not used. Results are normalised across platforms, with `Interface.raw`
  as an opt-in escape hatch for platform-specific data.
- `Interface` type, including `is_loopback` computed from the *addresses*
  rather than the name — `lo`, `lo0` and `Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1` share no
  spelling.
- **`try_parse(value, parser)`** — generic non-raising parse returning the value
  or `None` — and **`is_valid(value, parser)`**, the boolean counterpart. Both
  work with any factory, and swallow only `ValueError`/`TypeError`; anything
  else propagates rather than being disguised as a rejected value.
- `is_valid_network`, alongside the existing `is_valid_ip` and a new
  `is_valid_mac`.
- Type aliases `IPAddressLike`, `IPNetworkLike`, `MACLike` for accepted-input
  positions.
- `MACAddress` gains ordering (so MACs sort), `.oui`, `.is_multicast`,
  `.is_local` / `.is_universal`, and `as_str(sep, upper=True)` for the
  uppercase rendering Windows tooling favours. Case stays presentational — it
  never affects equality or hashing.
- `resolve()` gains `timeout`, `port` and `tcp`.
- `ping` gains `timeout` and `ipv6` family selection, a wall-clock cap on the
  subprocess (`-W` bounds the reply wait, not a hung resolver), and a
  missing-binary guard. Sub-second timeouts round **up**, never to 0 — some
  `ping` implementations read 0 as "wait forever".
- `get_ip`, `get_default_port`, and `is_link_scoped`, ported from a downstream
  consumer.
- **`port_scheme(port)`** — the inverse of `get_default_port`, and
  **`register_port(scheme, port, canonical=False)`** to extend or override the
  table. The built-in list grew from 6 entries to ~30. Where several schemes
  share a port, the canonical one is returned, and registering an alias does not
  silently change what a port maps back to.

### Removed

- **`active_nic_addresses`, `get_ip_address`, `nic_info`.** All three are
  superseded by `get_interfaces()`, which is correct where they were not.
  `active_nic_addresses()` returned an arbitrary *single* address — whatever
  `gethostbyname_ex` happened to list first, routinely a WSL/VM/VPN adapter
  rather than the real NIC — and discarded the rest despite the plural name.
  `get_ip_address`/`nic_info` were POSIX-only.
- **`nslookup`.** Superseded by `resolve()`, which is the same lookup with a
  better argument order; keeping both would have been two names for one thing.
- **`parse_ip` / `parse_network`.** They mapped only empty strings to `None`
  while still raising on malformed input — a split contract that made "returns
  `None`" mean two different things. Use `try_parse(value, IPAddr)` /
  `try_parse(value, IPNet)`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Initial release.
- IP factories `IPAddress`, `IPInterface`, `IPNetwork` (non-strict networks) over
  the standard library, plus concrete-type re-exports (`IPv4Address`, ...).
- `MACAddress` type: parses colon/hyphen/dot/bare forms, case-normalised,
  hashable, with `as_str(sep)` rendering and a `_VALID_MAC` pattern.
- Tolerant `parse_ip` / `parse_network` (empty input → `None`) and a
  non-raising `is_valid_ip`.
- `nslookup` (list-of-strings contract, `[]` on failure, uses `resolver.resolve`),
  `ping`, and local NIC helpers `active_nic_addresses` / `get_ip_address` /
  `nic_info`.
